The aim of this Project was to create a weather Api app that returns to the user the weather data in his area. He can also search for other locations. WeatherWise is a web application that fetches the weather forecast data and other details from the <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">Weather API</a>. The app features a main page with a searchBar where the user is prompted to write a location. This then directes him to the dashboard where he can see the weather in that area but also plan his day by writing a TODO list.

## ⚙️ Features

- Search for Location weather using SearchBar
- Get Current Area Geolocation
- Todo List
- Display the weather for the day but also the forecast of the next 7 days.
- Creative Design
